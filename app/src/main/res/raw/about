CLUB MEETINGS
WMHD Online Radio has general club meetings every odd week of the quarter (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10) at 5PM in the basement of BSB, room 032. In these meetings we discuss/listen to music, plan events, stream live radio shows, and also run workshops on things like DJing, equipment setup, and the recording process. We also have workshops that are DJ-specific for online streaming or live DJing at events, usually on Wednesdays when there are not meetings.

ROOM INFO
We have three main rooms in BSB basement: the Broadcasting Room (BSB032), Recording Studio (BSB030), and Recording Booth (BSB028). We also have a storage room for our hundreds of CDs and records and equipment. We have one of the largest spaces on campus for a club and they are amazing. Come hang out in them! Every Rose-Hulman student is welcome to use the rooms. See “Campus Services” for information about renting the recording studio & booth. The hours that the radio is open weekly are posted below.
